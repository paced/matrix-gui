# Matrix GUI

Simple clientside-contained app to get a 2d array from GUI

## Introduction

Visit the site [here](https://paced.github.io/matrix-gui/).

I tutored a code camp for three days in the Swift programming language. High schoolers have an easier job visualising what an array looks like when you use them for mazes (as well as some programmers) so I made a quick pure JavaScript web app to create a maze array. Just clone the repo/download and run the static page.

## Usage

There are four block types:

- **Path/Empty**: white
- **Wall**: orange
- **End**: red
- **Start**: green

Click Generate to create a rectangular table that can be manipulated on screen. Click Get Array to get text that can be copied to Slick projects as a 2D array.

Though I wrote this while under the employ of LifeIsTech Japan, I was not contracted as a developer (rather, a tutor). I am not blocked from releasing under a license of my choice.
